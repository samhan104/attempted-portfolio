Day 1: 
- Set up the necessary html,css,js files
- found and added image that I wanted as the background for my website

Day 2: 
I wanted the page to shrink, and have it be a carousel to choose as the menu.
- configured page to shrink when clicking button
- configured navigation buttons to appear when page shrank 
    - button would not position where i wanted (left/right)

Day 3:
- instead of trying to force buttons to be left right, kept it up down and labeled them next and back 
- used jquery toggleClass to have class be added/removed at click of button
- deployed using netlify and found that my background wasn't coming up at all
    - tested 3 more times
- gave up background and created the rest of the pages (about,resume, portfolio, contact)

Day 4
- tested background like 2-3 more times again
    - didn't work again
- gave up again and attempted github pages
    - gave up on that too
- finished the rough layout of the rest of the pages

Day 5 
- figured out why the background wasn't working
- linked all the pages, and created images for the links
- seems to work somewhat barely like everything i do
