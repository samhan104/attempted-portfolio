                <p>Hello! I'm Samuel Han. I've always been interested in learning and creating new things. <br>
                    Because of those interests, I pursued audio engineering at Drexel University and got my BS in Music Industry - Recording Arts and Music Production <br>
                <br>
                To satisfy my interest in learning, I've always tinkered around with technology, trying to see what they could do that many people didn't know <br>
                I felt like I could do more to understand technology, so now I'm currently attending a coding bootcamp to really understand how software works</p>
